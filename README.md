# Voyage
Simple card deck for use with CGS.

Voyage is a game about getting rid of your cards. Like Uno, the primary difference is that in Voyage, cards are split into two types: LAND and SEA. SEA cards may only be played on other SEA cards, and LAND cards must be played on LAND cards. The only exception to this rule is PORT cards. These may be played on either LAND or SEA cards and let players shift between the two card types. The game ends when a player gets rid of all their cards and a PORT card is played. 

If a player cannot play a card, they must draw.

Cards are either LIGHTLY or HEAVILY modified. These function as the power cards and facilitate player interaction. MAP cards have different play rules that directly impact this as well.
